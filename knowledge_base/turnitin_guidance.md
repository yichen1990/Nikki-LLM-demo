# Turnitin AI Detection Guidance

## Purpose

This document provides guidance on interpreting Turnitin AI detection scores within an academic context.

## Key Principles

- AI percentage indicators are probabilistic signals, not definitive proof of misconduct.
- A high AI score does not automatically indicate academic dishonesty.
- Scores must be interpreted alongside academic judgment.

## Recommended Review Process

When reviewing a submission with elevated AI score:

1. Assess writing consistency across the document.
2. Evaluate conceptual understanding demonstrated.
3. Compare with student's prior submissions.
4. Consider inviting the student to explain their work.

## Prohibited Practice

Markers must not assign penalties based solely on AI percentage scores without contextual academic review.

## Policy Alignment

All decisions must align with institutional Academic Misconduct and Plagiarism Policy.
