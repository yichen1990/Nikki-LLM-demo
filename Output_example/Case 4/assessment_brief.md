**Assessment Brief**

**Assignment 2: Secure RAG Implementation (30%)**

**Unit:** LLM Security and Governance (Postgraduate Unit)

**Learning Outcomes:** 3, 4, and 5

**Objective:** Design and implement a secure RAG pipeline with structured output enforcement, governance strategies for AI deployment, and conduct prompt injection testing.

**Instructions:**

1. Develop a comprehensive report detailing the design of your secure RAG pipeline.
2. Implement a working prototype of your RAG pipeline using industry-standard tools and technologies.
3. Conduct a thorough analysis of your pipeline's security features and governance strategies.
4. Perform prompt injection testing on your pipeline, reporting:
	* Attack success rate
	* False block rate
	* JSON validity rate
	* Citation coverage
5. Include an ethics/compliance section addressing cyber law and regulatory considerations.

**Submission Requirements:**

* Report (max 10 pages): detailing the design of your secure RAG pipeline, governance strategies, and prompt injection testing results.
* Working prototype code (zipped or linked repository).
* Ethics/Compliance document (max 2 pages): addressing cyber law and regulatory considerations.

**Grading Criteria:** Refer to the Marking Rubric below.
