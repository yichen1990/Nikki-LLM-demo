  "text": "A high Turnitin AI score is a probabilistic signal that indicates the likelihood of AI-generated content, but it does not automatically indicate academic dishonesty. According to the provided guidance, scores must be interpreted alongside academic judgment, considering factors such as writing consistency, conceptual understanding demonstrated, and prior submissions.\n\nHere are some key points to consider when interpreting high Turnitin AI scores:\n\n* A high score is not definitive proof of misconduct.\n* Scores should be evaluated in context, taking into account the student's writing style and subject matter expertise.\n* Markers should assess whether the content is consistent with the student's prior work and understanding of the subject.\n* It may be necessary to invite the student to explain their work before making a final decision.\n\nSources:\nturnitin_guidance.md"
